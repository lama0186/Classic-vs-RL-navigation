## Navigation Approaches Comparison

### 1. Classic Navigation Stack
- **Relies on predefined algorithms**: e.g., SLAM for localization and mapping, and A* or DWA for path planning.  
- **Modular methodology**: each component (localization, planning, obstacle avoidance) is independent and can be tuned separately.  
- **Safe and predictable**: behavior is consistent and reliable.  
- **Limitations**: can be rigid and less adaptable to highly dynamic or unfamiliar environments.  

### 2. Reinforcement Learning (RL) Navigation
- **Learns from experience**: the robot improves through trial and error in a simulated or real training environment.  
- **Can be end-to-end**: directly maps sensor data to movement commands without splitting into separate modules.  
- **Highly adaptable**: can handle complex, dynamic environments.  
- **Limitations**: requires significant training time and resources; may not generalize well if the real environment differs from the training one.  

### 3. Main Difference
- **Classic Navigation** → Fixed rules and algorithms, guaranteed performance, but less flexibility.  
- **Reinforcement Learning** → Experience-based intelligence, more flexibility, but safety and reliability depend heavily on training quality.
